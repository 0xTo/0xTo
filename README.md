## About me
🌠 Passionate about computers since I was very (very) young, I am very curious and I like to learn and discover new things. <br />
🌟For some time I have been learning programming and I would like to make my job. I am someone with a lot of convictions, especially about crypto-currencies and blockchain.<br />
🗺 I also like to travel a lot, especially in countries very different from mine and discover new people, new personalities, new everyday life.<br />
🚀 I have other hobbies like space, economy, and science.<br />

- 🔭 I’m currently working on personnal projects (some are opensources). 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to be a better me.
